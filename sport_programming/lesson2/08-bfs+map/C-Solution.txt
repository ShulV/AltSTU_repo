Problem C:  Painted Cube

Standard breadth-first state search works fine here, using a simple
vector (or pair of vectors) as a queue and a hashtable or map to keep
track of seen states.  The problem was written specifically to make it
relatively easy to compress all the state into a single 32-bit
integer; if you tried to store a string representation of the entire
board, your solution would probably exceed the time limit.  Exiting as
soon as you found a solution helped speed too, but was not completely
necessary as the entire state space is no more than 26 * (26 choose 6)
or just under 6 million states.  The code required was somewhat
lengthy but very straightforward with no gotchas.
