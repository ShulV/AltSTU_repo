Problem K:  Tile Cut

There is almost always a flow problem in competitions at this level;
you need to be able to recognize it and convert the statement to a
graph.  In this case we had incoming and outging vertices
corresponding to each square, with an edge of capacity one between the
two.  In addition, the outgoing vertex of each W was connected to the
incoming vertex of each I, and the outgoing vertex of each I was
connected to the incoming vertex of each N.  Connect all the incoming
vertices of each W to the source and the outgoing vertices of each N
to the sink, and run your canned integer max flow algorithm.
