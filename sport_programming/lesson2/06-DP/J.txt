Temple Build
The Dwarves of Middle Earth are renowned for their delving and smithy 
ability, but they are also master builders. During the time of the 
dragons, the dwarves found that above ground the
buildings that were most resistant to attack were truncated square pyramids 
(a square pyramid
that does not go all the way up to a point, but instead has a 
at square on top).

The dwarves knew what the ideal building shape should be based on the 
height they wanted
and the size of the square base at the top and bottom. 
They typically had three different sizes of
cubic bricks with which to work. Their goal was to maximize the volume 
of such a building based on the following rules:

The building is constructed of layers; 
each layer is a single square of bricks of a single size.

No part of any brick may extend out from the
ideal shape, either to the sides or at the top. The
resulting structure will have jagged sides and may
be shorter than the ideal shape, but it must fit
completely within the ideal design. 

The picture
at the right is a vertical cross section of one such tower.
There is no limit on how many bricks of each type can be used.


Input
Each line of input will contain six entries, each separated by a single space. 

The entries represent the ideal temple height, 
the size of the square base at the bottom, 
the size of the square base at the top 
(all three as non-negative integers less than or equal to one million), 
then three sizes of cubic bricks (all three as non-negative integers less 
than or equal to ten thousand). Input is terminated
upon reaching end of le.


Output
For each line of input, output the maximum possible volume based on the 
given rules, one output
per line.
