Problem J:  Temple Build

This was a dynamic programming problem, where the function you were
optimizing was f(a), the greatest volume you could obtain in a temple
of height a, subject to the constraints.  Starting with f(0)=0, you
build the possible temple heights by adding in layers of each of the
possible three brick sizes, calculating the resulting total volume by
adding the volume of a new brick layer to the volume of a
previously-calculated shorter temple.  It was important to realize the
final temple might have a height shorter than that requested, so you
needed to scan the array for the greatest volume rather than return
the result at the top of the array, but the picture should have made
this clear.
